<h1 align="center">Toolpad</h1>

- [Toolpad Core](https://mui.com/toolpad/core/introduction/) is a framework approach to internal tools. Through high-level components and data management interfaces, It's tightly integrated with [MUI X](http://github.com/mui/mui-x) and MUI's core libraries like [Material UI](http://github.com/mui/material-ui). You can use it as a framework for admin dashboards and CRUD apps!
- [Toolpad Studio](https://mui.com/toolpad/studio/getting-started/) is a self-hosted low-code admin builder designed to extend the Toolpad Core React components. It's for developers of all trades who want to save time building internal applications. Drag and drop from a catalog of pre-built components, connect to any data source and build apps quickly.

## We are making some changes

A [big addition](https://github.com/mui/mui-toolpad/discussions/3311) is happening. We're working on Toolpad Core, a framework approach to internal tools. Through high-level components and data management interfaces, we aim to revamp the app building experience that involves tabular data. It will be tightly integrated with MUI X and Core libraries, and would act as your go to framework for admin dashboards and CRUD apps!
