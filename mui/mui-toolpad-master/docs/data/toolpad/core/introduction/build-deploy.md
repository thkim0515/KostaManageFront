# Build and Deploy

<p class="description">With Toolpad Core, you can build and deploy on your own terms </p>

## Install step

Install required depdencies via:

<codeblock storageKey="package-manager">

```bash npm
npm install
```

```bash yarn
yarn
```

</codeblock>

## Build step

This command creates an optimized production build for the app and outputs the generated files:

<codeblock storageKey="package-manager">

```bash npm
npm run build
```

```bash yarn
yarn build
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm build
```

</codeblock>

## Start step

Once the build has been made, you can deploy it to any service of your choice!

To serve the app once built, run:

<codeblock storageKey="package-manager">

```bash npm
npm run start
```

```bash yarn
yarn start
```

</codeblock>
