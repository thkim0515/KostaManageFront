# Toolpad Core

<p class="description">A framework to build full-stack apps, fast. It can be used as a Next.js starter, or integrated within an existing React project to build dashboards and internal tools. </p>

This framework leverages the existing suite of components offered by MUI, and ties them together with the most commonly-used backend integrations to help you create dashboards fast. Imagine a React dashboard template but with backend features like authentication, role-based access control and data fetching already included. It comes with the guarantee of MUI's enterprise-tested components, and the Toolpad team's focus on using the latest stable libraries, and prioritising razor-sharp performance.

## Overview

:::info
Visit the [installation guide](/toolpad/core/installation/) to learn how to install the package correctly.
:::

Toolpad can be multiple things: a set of low-level primitives for common use-cases like state management across components, a Next.js starter with features like authentication and data-fetching baked-in, or an umbrella framework to help bring together your existing internal tooling applications. To sum up: it is a framework that integrates many disparate libraries with MUI's components, which otherwise require a lot of inefficient glue code to work together. The framework is accessible through a Command Line Interface (CLI) which generates starter code quickly based on features needed or example templates to be followed.

The framework follows the open-core model, with some features being available under the MIT license, and some being under a paid license.
