## Community help

Welcome to the MUI community as a Toolpad Core user!
These are the best places to start asking questions and looking for answers when you need help.

### GitHub

Toolpad uses GitHub issues to track bug reports and feature requests.

If you think you've found a bug in the codebase, or you have an idea for a new feature, please [search the issues on GitHub](https://github.com/mui/mui-toolpad/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed) before opening a new one, to ensure you're not creating a duplicate.

- [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mui/mui-toolpad/issues/new/choose) for issues or feature requests.
- [Start a GitHub discussion](https://github.com/mui/mui-toolpad/discussions) for a broad topic. Here you can engage with the team and the discussion would likely result in one or more GitHub issues.

#### New issue guidelines

- Please follow one of the issue templates provided on GitHub.
- Please use a succinct description that helps others find similar issues.
  - ‚ùå _"It doesn't work"_
  - ‚úÖ _"Add support for {{new feature}}"_
- Please don't group multiple topics in one issue.
- Please don't comment "+1" on an issue. It spams the maintainers and doesn't help move the issue forward. Use GitHub reactions instead (üëç).

### Discord

Toolpad is also present on Discord, you can connect with other users and get help from the community. To join, simply click on this [Discord server](https://mui.com/r/discord/) and follow the instructions. Looking forward to seeing you there!

### Stack¬†Overflow

Stack¬†Overflow contains a wealth of information about MUI products. Toolpad Core is a new product and you can start by [posting a question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/toolpad) to get help from community experts as well as maintainers.

### Social media

Toolpad has a growing presence on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/Toolpad_).
You can use it to share what you're working on and connect with other developers.

Please keep in mind that we don't actively monitor direct messages on the company's social media accounts, so this is _not_ a good way to get in touch with us directly.

### Direct email

If email is your thing, the team can be directly reached at toolpad@mui.com.
